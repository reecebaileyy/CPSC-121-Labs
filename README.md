# CPSC 131 Data Structures

# Execution and Testing

Execution and testing are controlled with a *Makefile* written for [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). The included Makefile has several targets you can use during development. As mentioned earlier, do not modify the *Makefile* file.

See a help menu with available commands:
```console
$ make help
```

See a quick preview/estimate of your grade with the following command:
```console
$ make test
```

Execute the program defined by *main.cpp*:
```console
$ make run
```

Run tests in debug mode (with gdb):
```console
$ make debug-test
```

## Contributing

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
